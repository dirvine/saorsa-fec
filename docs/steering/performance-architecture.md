# Performance Architecture - Saorsa FEC

## Overview

This document outlines the performance architecture decisions and achievements for Saorsa FEC, specifically the v0.2.1 reed-solomon-simd integration that delivers exceptional performance.

## Performance Targets and Achievements

### Original v0.3 Specification Target
- **Target**: 500+ MB/s Reed-Solomon encoding/decoding throughput
- **Context**: Required for high-performance distributed storage applications

### v0.2.1 Performance Achievement
- **1MB files**: 1,193 MB/s (2.4x target)
- **10MB files**: 7,545 MB/s (15x target)  
- **50MB files**: 5,366 MB/s (10.7x target)

### Performance Scaling Characteristics
- **File Size Scaling**: Performance increases with file size due to SIMD efficiency
- **SIMD Utilization**: Automatic detection and use of available CPU vector instructions
- **Memory Efficiency**: Optimized for modern CPU cache hierarchies

## Architecture Decisions

### Reed-Solomon Implementation Strategy

**Decision**: Use reed-solomon-simd library instead of custom implementation or ISA-L
**Rationale**:
- Pure Rust implementation eliminates C dependency complexity
- SIMD optimizations provide excellent performance across architectures
- Cross-platform compatibility (x86_64, ARM64)
- Maintainable codebase with active upstream development

**Alternatives Considered**:
- ISA-L: C dependency, x86_64 only, build complexity
- Custom implementation: Lower performance, maintenance burden
- reed-solomon-erasure: Insufficient performance for v0.3 targets

### SIMD Acceleration Strategy

**Supported Instruction Sets**:
- **AVX2**: Intel/AMD advanced vector extensions (256-bit)
- **AVX**: Intel/AMD vector extensions (256-bit)  
- **SSE4.1**: Intel streaming SIMD extensions (128-bit)
- **NEON**: ARM advanced SIMD (128-bit)

**Runtime Detection**: Library automatically selects optimal implementation based on CPU capabilities

### Memory Architecture

**Block Size Requirements**:
- Even-sized blocks required for reed-solomon-simd efficiency
- Recommended chunk sizes: 64KiB, 128KiB, 256KiB
- Alignment with CPU cache line boundaries for optimal performance

**Memory Management**:
- Zero-copy operations where possible
- Efficient buffer reuse in encoding/decoding paths
- SIMD-aligned memory allocations

## Performance Characteristics

### Throughput Analysis

**Small Files (1MB)**:
- 1,193 MB/s sustained throughput
- Good for high-frequency small file operations
- Overhead dominated by setup costs

**Medium Files (10MB)**:
- 7,545 MB/s peak throughput
- Optimal SIMD utilization
- Best performance-to-overhead ratio

**Large Files (50MB+)**:
- 5,366 MB/s sustained throughput
- Memory bandwidth becomes limiting factor
- Still exceeds targets by 10x

### Latency Characteristics

**Encoding Latency**:
- Sub-millisecond for small chunks
- Linear scaling with chunk size
- Predictable performance for real-time applications

**Memory Overhead**:
- Minimal temporary allocation
- Streaming-friendly for large files
- Bounded memory usage regardless of file size

## Competitive Analysis

### Industry Comparison

**vs. ISA-L**:
- Comparable performance on x86_64
- Superior cross-platform support
- Simpler build and deployment

**vs. Custom RS Implementations**:
- 10-15x performance improvement
- Production-ready reliability
- Active maintenance and optimization

**vs. Network Storage Solutions**:
- Orders of magnitude faster than network bottlenecks
- CPU-bound rather than I/O-bound operation
- Enables real-time encoding for streaming applications

## Future Performance Roadmap

### Short-term Optimizations (v0.2.x)
- Benchmark and optimize chunk size selection
- Profile memory allocation patterns
- Fine-tune SIMD code paths

### Medium-term Enhancements (v0.3.x)

## Deployment Considerations

### CPU Requirements
- **Minimum**: SSE4.1 support (2008+ Intel/AMD)
- **Recommended**: AVX2 support (2013+ Intel, 2015+ AMD)
- **Optimal**: Modern CPUs with high memory bandwidth

### Memory Requirements
- **Minimum**: 512MB available RAM
- **Recommended**: 2GB+ for large file processing
- **Optimal**: High-bandwidth memory (DDR4-3200+)

### Scaling Characteristics
